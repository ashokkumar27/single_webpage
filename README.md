## Description

### ← index.html(Main file)

Here is where you can edit/replace the content of the website with your own content. Apart from that most of the images can be added to the *img* folder and
edit the name accordingly in index.html

### ← style.css(under CSS folder)

CSS files add styling rules to your content. If you wish to change the background image for the home section, you can do it here by editing with your own image address:
##
*#home-section {
background: url('../img/first_cover.jpg') no-repeat center top;*

### ← js/

If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.
